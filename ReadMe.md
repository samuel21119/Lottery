# Lottery
![Icon](icon.ico)

This application is built for my senior high school's musical teacher, because the applications and webpages she used in lession **suck**.  

This application included two functions:

1. Scoreboard
2. Lottery

Also, there's an English version too. Just overwrite `index.html` with `index.html.en`.
